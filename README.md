For Task 4, I built an AI-based Recommendation System using Java to suggest products or content based on user preferences and behavior. The system was designed to demonstrate how modern platforms such as e-commerce websites and streaming services provide personalized recommendations to users. To implement the recommendation engine efficiently, I integrated Apache Mahout, an open-source machine learning library that provides scalable algorithms for collaborative filtering, clustering, and classification. The primary objective of this project was to develop a Java program capable of analyzing sample user-item interaction data and generating meaningful recommendations automatically. The recommendation system was based on collaborative filtering, a widely used technique that predicts a user’s interests by analyzing preferences from similar users. I prepared a sample dataset containing user IDs, product IDs (or content IDs), and corresponding ratings to simulate real-world user behavior. This dataset was stored in a structured format such as CSV, which was then loaded into the program using Mahout’s FileDataModel class. The engine used similarity measures such as Pearson correlation or Euclidean distance to determine how closely users’ preferences matched with one another. Based on these similarity scores, the system identified nearest neighbors and generated recommendations by suggesting items liked by similar users but not yet interacted with by the target user. The program was structured into modular components, including data loading, similarity computation, neighborhood selection, and recommendation generation. Exception handling mechanisms were implemented to manage issues such as missing data files, invalid inputs, or runtime errors during model training. The output of the program displayed recommended products or content in a clear and readable format, showing item IDs along with predicted preference scores. Through this project, I gained practical experience in implementing machine learning concepts within a Java application and understood the working principles of recommendation engines used by platforms like online shopping stores and media streaming services. I learned the difference between user-based and item-based collaborative filtering and explored how scalability can be achieved using optimized algorithms. Additionally, I understood how recommendation systems improve user engagement, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase business revenue by providing personalized suggestions. The project strengthened my knowledge of data modeling, similarity metrics, and algorithm implementation in a real-world context. Overall, this AI-based Recommendation System provided hands-on exposure to integrating machine learning libraries with Java, processing structured datasets, and building an intelligent system capable of analyzing user preferences to deliver accurate and relevant recommendations.
